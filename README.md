## Introduction

Hey ðŸ‘‹ thanks for taking the time to look through our resources!

Welcome to our Next.js starter project for marketing websites. It's built with Next.js 13's app router and is set up with TypeScript and Tailwind. For component development and code quality, we've integrated Storybook, Prettier, and ESLint.

This template is designed to give you a head start on marketing website projects, streamlining the initial setup process. It's all prepared for you to build upon.

## Getting started

To begin, click the "Use this template" button at the top of this repository or clone it locally.

## Installing dependencies

We use pnpm to install our dependencies

`pnpm install`

## Running the project

Once you're ready, start the development server:

`pnpm dev`

Head over to http://localhost:3000 to see the initial setup.

## Storybook

To access your components in Storybook, run:

`pnpm storybook`

Storybook should automatically open a tab at http://localhost:6006/

## Linting and formatting
